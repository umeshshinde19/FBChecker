# FBChecker
## General
Check if a password correspond to an email for Facebook Account. All you need is a _passowrd_ and an associated _email_, you can check via bash if the password corresponds to the target email. The script provides:
 - Check if the password is correct for a given email
 - Check if it is enabled Double-Check for the target account
 - You can verify a list of password (up to 20 attempts per time)

## Features

You can choose between manual insertion or importing a _.csv_ file with separator ";". The result is a nice screen that informs you if the login is correct, if the password is bad, of there is double-check.

You get some useful information and an HTML-OUTPUT page that you can read to see the output of the operation.

Some characters are not allowed

## Warning
My intentions are good, I created this simple script only to verify, I don't want to make **BRUTE FORCE** attacks to Facebook Accounts. Anyway if the account has Double-Chceck (via SMS) you can only knows the password of the Facebook Account.

Good Luck!
